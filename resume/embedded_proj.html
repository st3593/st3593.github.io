        <h2>Brief Description</h2>
        <p>
          A Circuit Playground board will be used to detect a set of sit-ups, push-ups, jumping-jacks, or squats.

        <h2>User Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          The device will be placed on the user's chest with the micro-USB directed towards the ceiling. Once they are in the 
          starting position for the exercise, they will press left button #4 to start the set. LED #13 will light up to indicate 
          that the device is recording the body's movements. Each set will consist of 5 repetitions. After each repetition, a 
          NeoPixel will light up, indicating which exercise has been performed. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Red - No exercise detected </li>
          <li>Purple - Situp</li>
          <li>Green - Pushup</li>
          <li>Blue - Jumping Jack</li>
          <li>Yellow - Squat</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After each repetition, there will also be a beeping sound to indicate the end of the repetition. Each repetition takes 
          4 seconds, so a set consisting of 5 repetitions takes 20 seconds. After the set has been completed, LED #13 will turn 
          off to indicate that the device is no longer recording the body's movements. The user can press right button #19 to 
          reset the NeoPixels. Once again, the user will get into starting position and press left button #4 to start the set.
