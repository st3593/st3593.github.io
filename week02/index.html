        I learned that the following principles need to be upheld to ensure that the Web continues to grow and remains useful: 
        universality, open and royalty-free standards, separation of layers, net neutrality, and no snooping. The reading has 
        strengthened my belief that the Web belongs to everyone, not to be controlled by the government or a company. Infringing 
        on our rights to the Web is a violation of free speech and an attack on democracy. The Web should remain open to serve as 
        a resource for information and encourage innovation. For example, the discovery of a drug to combat Alzheimer's disease was 
        due to research labs opening their data and collaboration. I take the Web for granted and expect it to always be available, 
        but the Web continues to be threatened by censorship, government monitoring, and greedy companies seeking larger profits. 
        Thus, public outcry is essential to fight against the violation of our network rights. In modern day, laws need to catch up 
        with the expanding Web to protect users' privacy and rights.

          "Consider a future device ... in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is 
          mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to 
          his memory."

        As Vannevar Bush predicted, devices such as cellphones and computers now serve as "intimate supplement[s] to [one's] memory." 
        These devices allow us to connect to the Web and gain access to various information resources, which reinforces why we must 
        protect the Web against the threats described previously. The Web allows humans to store information outside our own memory and 
        gain information that we would not have had access to otherwise.
